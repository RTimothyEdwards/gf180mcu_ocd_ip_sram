Work converting the 5V SRAM to 3.3V.

1. Removed the DUALGATE layer from the 5V SRAM using klayout

2. Read the result into magic (see directory magic_orig).  This is a
   DRC-clean layout where all devices have been converted to 3.3V.
   It has the same layout as the 5V SRAM and so does not save any
   area.

3. Copied files to magic/.

4. Reworked the core SRAM cell for minimum area.  Transistors scale
   from 0.6um to 0.28um, a scale factor of 14/30.  The reworked
   core is of course unable to get to less than half size because
   the contacts don't scale.  Ultimately got it to approximately
   0.7x the original size (which is about 1/2 area).

   Will rework the remaining cells using two tactics:

5. Make a version scaled by 14/30 (see directory magic_scaled2).
   All transistors in this directory will be the correct size for
   the final layout

6. Make a version scaled by 7/10 (see directory magic_scaled).
   All layout except transistors will be approximately the correct
   size for the final layout

7. Edit transistors from magic_scaled2 to bring the contact size and
   spacing back to DRC clean values.  Also edit all contact cells.

8. Create new composite directory (see directory magic_final).
   Copy transistors and contacts from magic_scaled2 into this directory.
   Copy the core cell from magic/.  Copy everything else from magic_scaled/.

9. Rework layout to get it DRC clean.
